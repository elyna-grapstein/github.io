### Bio
> I am a science-driven creative interested in addressing environmental issues. I have a broad range of experience in ecological work in the public and private sectors, including work as a field botanist; air quality monitoring; environmental enforcement; riparian restoration; and science education. Currently I am working as an air quality specialist, but my interests are diverse and I am eager to connect with others who are motivated to protect our planet.

### I am looking forward to:
> Learning how to effectively and efficiently analyze and visualize large datasets that communicate global challenges.

### This is where I am:
